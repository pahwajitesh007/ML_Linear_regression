Simple Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent
The coefficients used in simple linear regression can be found using stochastic gradient descent.

Linear regression is a linear system and the coefficients can be calculated analytically using linear algebra. Stochastic gradient descent is not used to calculate the coefficients for linear regression in practice (in most cases).

Linear regression does provide a useful exercise for learning stochastic gradient descent which is an important algorithm used for minimizing cost functions by machine learning algorithms.

As stated above, our linear regression model is defined as follows:

y = B0 + B1 * x
